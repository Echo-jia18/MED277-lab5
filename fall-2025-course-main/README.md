## 1.2 About This Course

This course explores the design, implementation, and evaluation of large language model (LLM)-based agents. Students will begin with foundational topics in LLM capabilities, prompt engineering, and tool augmentation (e.g., code execution, search, and database access), then progress to advanced areas such as multi-step planning, memory management, and multi-agent collaboration. Emphasis is placed on hands-on system development, live assessment of individual understanding via oral exams, and critical analysis of agent behavior, including failure modes and ethical considerations. Assignments build toward a final take-home project that demonstrates a functioning AI agent system.
