# CSE 491 - AI Agents: Homework 0 Rubric 

This assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. The following rubric will be used when grading your submission and accompany homework video: 

## Functional Requirements:
* <u>xx /50 points:</u> Application successfully builds and runs using `docker-compose up --build`
* <u>xx /25 points:</u> AI chat interface isfunctional, with real-time responses
* <u>xx /25 points:</u> Resume and Homepage content was substantively modified from provided template

**GRADING POLICY**: 
- Each rubric component uses **"ALL OR NOTHING"** grading. That is, you will receive either the full points for a component, or zero points. There is no partial credit awarded for any rubric criteria.
- Points are awarded based on **functionality demonstrated**, not specific implementation decisions or code quality.

## Submission Requirements
1. **Demo Video** - See detailed video structure and instructions in the README.md file
2. **Code Repository** - All code properly committed and pushed to GitLab repository  
3. **Homework Submission Form** - Complete the required Google Form.

**CRITICAL**: Even if your application works perfectly, you will receive zero points if you do not submit the required demo video, code repository, and survey. Additionally, you will only receive points for functional requirements that are clearly demonstrated in your video submission. Even if your application meets a requirement perfectly, you will receive 0 points for that requirement if it is not shown in your video, or if you record the video but fail to upload it before the deadline through the homework submission form.
